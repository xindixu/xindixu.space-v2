= \"# Functional Porgramming\\nfunctions map input to output to produce a result \\n- core principles \\n  - functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. they only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation \\n  - functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data\\n  - functions have minimal side effects in the program \\n\\n\\n### Functional Programming Is About:\\n- isolated functions: there is no dependence on the state of the program \\n- pure functions: the same input always gives the same output\\n- functions with limited side effects: any changes, or mutations, to the sate of the program outside the function are carefully controlled\\n\\n### Functional Programming Terminology\\n- `callbacks`\\nthe functions that are passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function \\n```js\\narr.filter((val)=>val>4);\\n```\\n- `first class` functions\\nfunctions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value \\nall functions are first class functions in js\\n\\n- `higher order` functions\\nfunctions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value \\n\\n- `lambda`\\nwhen functions are passed into nother function, or returned from another function, then those functions get passed in or returned called a `lambda`\\n\\n```js\\n/**\\n * A long process to prepare green tea.\\n * @return {string} A cup of green tea.\\n **/\\nconst prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';\\n\\n/**\\n * A long process to prepare black tea.\\n * @return {string} A cup of black tea.\\n **/\\nconst prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';\\n\\n/**\\n * Get given number of cups of tea.\\n * @param {function():string} prepareTea The type of tea preparing function.\\n * @param {number} numOfCups Number of required cups of

Code\\n**imperative programming**: uses statements that change a program's state; focues on describing *how* a program operates\\n`for(let a of arr)`\\n**declarative programming**: building the structure and elements of program; focues on describing *what* a program should do (logic of a computation without describing its control flow)\\n\\n### Avoid Mutation and Side Effects Using Functional Programming\\n`mutation`: change things\\n`side effect`: outcome of mutation\\n`pure function`: function that doesn't cause any side effects, ideal functions\\n\\n`arr.splice(beg,numItemsToDel);` - mutate the array\\n`arr.slice(beg,end);` - will not mutate the array\\n\\n### Pass Argument to Avoid External Dependence in a Function\\nalways declare dependencies explicitly \\nif the function depends on a variable or object, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as arguments\\nthe function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it \\n\\n### Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions\\n```js\\nlet bookList = [\\\"xxx\\\",\\\"yyy\\\",\\\"zzz\\\"]\\n// bad\\nfunction add (bookName) {\\n  return bookList.push(bookName);\\n}\\n\\nfunction remove (bookName) {\\n  if (bookList.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {\\n    return bookList.splice(0, 1, bookName);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// good\\nfunction add(list, bookName){\\n  return [...list, bookName];\\n}\\nfunction remove(list, bookName){\\n  let newList = [...list];\\n  let index = newList.indexOf(bookName);\\n  if(index >= 0){\\n    return newList.splice(index, 1);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Functions as Arguments, Return a Function from another Function\\n`first class objects`: functions are considered as first class objects, which means they can be used like any other object; they can be saved in varibales, stored in an object, or passed as a function arguments \\n`Array.prototype.map()`\\niterate through each item in an array, creates a new array *without changing* the original one after applying a `callback` function to every element \\n\\n```js\\nrating = watchList.map( (obj) => ({\\\"title\\\":obj[\\\"Title\\\"], \\\"rating\\\":obj[\\\"imdbRating\\\"]}) );\\n```\\n\\n*side node - callback*\\na callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing ---- hence, the name \\\"callback\\\"\\n\\nfunctions are objects, so functions can be passed into other functions as arguments. \\n`function a(b);`\\nfunctions that accepts this are called **higher-order functions** (function a)\\nfunctions that are passed as an argument is called a **callback function**\\n\\nJavaScript is an event-driven language. Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn't execute until other code has already finished execution\\n\\n```js\\nfunction doHomework(subject, callback) {\\n  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);\\n  callback();\\n}\\n\\ndoHomework('math', function() {\\n  alert('Finished my homework');\\n});\\n\\n// define callback functions elsewhere\\nfunction doHomework(subject, callback) {\\n  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);\\n  callback();\\n}\\nfunction alertFinished(){\\n  alert('Finished my homework');\\n}\\ndoHomework('math', alertFinished); // pass in alertFinished as an argument \\n```\\n\\n#### Exercises for callback functions\\n- implementing `map()` function\\n```js\\nArray.prototype.myMap = function(callback){\\n  var newArray = [];\\n  this.forEach((a) => newArray.push(callback(a)));\\n  return newArray;\\n}\\n\\nvar new_s = s.myMap(function(item){\\n  return item * 2;\\n});\\n```\\n- implementing `filter()` function\\n```js\\nArray.prototype.myFilter = function(callback){\\n  var newArray = [];\\n  this.forEach((a) => {\\n    callback(a) ? newArray.push(a) : null;\\n  })\\n  return newArray;\\n}\\n\\n\\nvar new_s = s.myFilter(function(item){\\n  return item % 2 === 1;\\n});\\n```\\n\\n#### Exercise for non-mutating functions \\n- `concat()` instead of `push()`\\n- `reduce()`\\n```js\\nvar averageRating;\\nlet ratings = watchList.filter((obj) => obj[\\\"Director\\\"] == \\\"Christopher Nolan\\\").map((obj) => parseFloat(obj[\\\"imdbRating\\\"]));\\nconsole.log(ratings);\\naverageRating = ratings.reduce((acc,cur) => acc + cur)/ratings.length;\\n\\n// Add your code above this line\\n\\nconsole.log(averageRating); \\n```\\n- `sort()`\\n```js\\narr.sort(function(a,b){\\n  return a < b; //reversed order\\n})\\n```\\nIf `function(a,b)` is less than 0, sort a to an index lower than b, i.e. a comes first.\\n\\n\\n\\n- every() to check that every element in an array meets a criteria \\n- some() to check if any element in an array meets a criteria \\n\\n## Currying function & partial application\\n- `arity` of a function is the number of arguments it requires\\n- `Currying` a function means to convert a function of N `arity` to N functions with 1 `arity`\\n\\n```js\\n//Un-curried function  \\nfunction unCurried(x, y) {  \\n  return x + y;  \\n}  \\n  \\n//Curried function  \\nfunction curried(x) {  \\n  return function(y) {  \\n    return x + y;  \\n  }  \\n}  \\ncurried(1)(2) // Returns 3\\n```\\n\\n```js\\n//Impartial function  \\nfunction impartial(x, y, z) {  \\n  return x + y + z;  \\n}  \\nvar partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);  \\npartialFn(10); // Returns 13\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"<h2>Project Desciption</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"text-center mb-4\\\">\\n  <img\\n    class=\\\"img-fluid\\\"\\n    src=\\\"/img/work/state-capitol.png\\\"\\n    alt=\\\"Texas capitol\\\"\\n    width=\\\"100%\\\"\\n  />\\n</div>\\n<p>\\n  I made this architecture model during the first half of 2017 and gave to my\\n  ex-boyfriend as a gift.

\\n- server consumes less resources \\n- ideal for mobile app on top \\n- easy to transform to Progressive Web Apps (local caching and offline expreience)\\n- great for working in teams: split the backend & frontend \\n\\n**Cons**\\n- not good for SEO\\n- pay attention to possible memory leaks\\n- rely on JS:\\n  - depends on power of device\\n  - visitor might just disable it\\n\\n## Overriding the navigation \\nHistory API\\n\\n## Declarative\\nReact is declarative approach to building UIs\\nComparing to HTML, react took building UI a lot more declaratively:\\n- build web interface without even touching DOM\\n- have an even system without having interact with the actual DOM events\\n\\nopposite **Iterative**\\njQuery: looking up elements in DOM using jQuery or DOM events\\nReact: tell the browser what we need, and never have to interact with DOM \\n\\n## Immutability\\na variable is immutable when its value cannot be chagned after it's created \\n`state` property should not be changed directly, but through `setState()`\\nredux: through `reducers`, which are functions\\n\\n**Why**\\n- mutations can be centralized -> easy debugging \\n- looks cleaner and simpler to understand\\n- **predictablity**: function will not change the value without you knowing\\n- **performance**: JS is quicker in swapping old reference with new than mutating an exsiting object\\n\\n## Purity \\n**Pure function**: function doesn't mutate object but just returns a new object \\n- should not cause side effects\\n- should return the same output when called multiple times with the same input\\n\\n**All Functional Components are Pure Components**\\n**Class Components can be pure is their output only depends on the props**\\n```jsx\\nclass Button extends React.Component {\\n  render(){\\n    return <button>{this.props.msg}</button>\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Composition\\ncomposition: build more complex functionality by combining small and focused functions\\n```js\\nconst list = ['Apple','Bee','Cake']\\nlist.map(item => item[0]).filter(item => item === 'A') // ['A']\\n```\\n\\n### Create speicalized version of a component\\n```jsx\\nconst

</div>\\n</div>\\n<h3>15 - Fifteen</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Not going to lie... our first meeting was a chaos. But it got better later\\n  after we settled down with team structures. We had 3 group: artistry,\\n  structure, and lights, and those further divided into several sub-teams. Since\\n  a lot of parts were connected with each other, close collaboration with\\n  EVERYONE was critical.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The picture on the left is our task breakdown, and each pink sticker\\n  represents one person in our class. This is the initial plan, and everything\\n  gets complicated as we moving down the road.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h3>2 - Two</h3>\\n<p>\\n  The picture on the right is my dear teammate, Delena, and me. We are in the\\n  hand's team, designing, constructing controllable raptor hands. After months\\n  of prototyping, we finally made 3 pairs of hands, with various designs that\\n  reflect the evolution of the raptors.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  After researching online, Delena came up with our very first HUGE hand. Around\\n  the 3rd week, we started learning and using CNC machine. Also around that\\n  point, I came up with several ideas: gloves to ensure performers' control and\\n  comfort, small jewelry chains to adjust the length, etc. Later on, we switched\\n  to the laser cutter for better precision. I was mostly in charge of cutting\\n  wood pieces and putting them and springs together to make functioning raptor\\n  hands, while Delena was mostly responsible for making gloves and attachment to\\n  the raptor hand.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>What I did...</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"row\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"text-center col-sm\\\">\\n    <img\\n      class=\\\"img-fluid\\\"\\n      src=\\\"/img/work/enron-raptors/hands.webp\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"hands\\\"\\n      width=\\\"100%\\\"\\n    />\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"text-center col-sm\\\">\\n    <img\\n      class=\\\"img-fluid\\\"\\n      src=\\\"/img/work/enron-raptors/board.webp\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"board\\\"\\n      width=\\\"100%\\\"\\n    />\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h3>Hand</h3>\\n<p>\\n  Delena was good at making artistic designs, while I was good at making\\n  incremental innovations. Basically, after we presented on Monday, we would\\n  discuss the next steps, based on suggestions, feedbacks, field-notes from\\n  classmates, performers, our director, and designer. Then, we would both work\\n  on editing the file in Illustrator, and I would go to the foundry and laser\\n  cut those wood pieces before Wednesday. After that, we would go paint those\\n  pieces, and I would assemble everything together. Delena made most of the\\n  gloves, and she has done a great job on sewing.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Claws</h3>\\n<p>\\n  At the middle of the semester, one of our classmates dropped the course, so we\\n  took over with making teeth and claws. I designed the 3D model in Maya, and\\n  cut it into two different lengths for teeth and claws. Then, I learned 3D\\n  printing process and started 3D printing. It was a very time-consuming\\n  process, and I am very thankful that our classmates contributed their time in\\n  monitoring the printer for us.\\n</p>\\n<h3>Lights</h3>\\n<p>\\n  During the final weeks, I jumped into the electric team, helping them to\\n  solder the central shields for lighting effects, and making the LED stripes,\\n  and EL wires. Since they were lack of people to meet the deadline, we worked\\n  very hard, late until 2 am, and all weekends. On Friday, few days before the\\n  unleashing date, we found a severe design problem: the LED stripes should be\\n  connected in parallel, to ensure the flow direction and enough voltage flowing\\n  through.

We found\\n  this Nutrition API, which grants us access to recipe informations and function\\n  calls.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Since we have to work with <strong>API</strong> and\\n  <strong>user authentication</strong>, we have to build a backend and database\\n  for our website. We choose Express.js and Node.js for back-end because they\\n  are <strong>written in JS</strong> and MongoDB because it is a\\n  <strong>non-relational database</strong>.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For frontend, we favors Angular because: 1) it has a well-organized and\\n  easy-to-understand documentation, 2) it use <strong>TypeScript</strong>, 3) it\\n  has a great <strong>CLI</strong> to help speed up the process. Although it is\\n  harder to learn than Vue.js and React, we still decided to use it.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"getstarted\\\">Get started</h3>\\n<p>\\n  I first started working on setting up both frontend and backend. It was quite\\n  challenging. Starting with backend, I set up <strong>Jwt-passport</strong> for\\n  user authentication, <strong>routes</strong> for functions related to users\\n  logins and API calls. Then, I did some configuration for database and\\n  passport.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Then, I started with the frontend. With the help of Angular-CLI, it was quite\\n  easy. I set up the routes and a few pages for basic structure of the web app.\\n  I also referred to Google Material Design to style the theme and components\\n  for the app.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"highlights\\\">Highlights</h3>\\n<p>\\n  There are several highlights during the implementation process. Some are quite\\n  challenging for me to figure out; some deepened my understanding a lot on the\\n  technologies I used.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"1usermodelandauthentication\\\">1. User model and authentication</h4>\\n<h5 id=\\\"backend\\\">Backend</h5>\\n<p>\\n  In the backend, I created a file <code>user.js</code> under\\n  <code>model</code> folder. Here, I connected to Mongoose, the database,\\n  constructed <code>UserSchema</code>, and exports as model for database. I\\n  wrote some functions such as <code>getUserById()</code> and\\n  <code>getUserByUsername()</code> with Mongoose built-in functions\\n  <code>findById()</code> and <code>findOne()</code>. Then, I implemented\\n  functions to hash and compare passwords with <strong>bcrypt.js</strong>. I\\n  used <code>hash()</code> function came with bcrypt to to encrypt password when\\n  adding users. For comparing passwords, I used <code>compare()</code> came with\\n  bcrypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Then, in the <code>routes</code> folder, I started another\\n  <code>user.js</code> file to call the functions I created in\\n  <code>model/user.js</code> file and create routes for frontend use. All the\\n  method used by router here is <code>post</code>. <code>Register</code> part is\\n  fairly easy: basically create user model with the data from the\\n  <code>request body</code> and add user to the database. For\\n  <code>authenticate</code>, it is a little bit more complicated. First, we call\\n  function <code>getUserByUsername()</code> and check if there is a particular\\n  user. Then, we call function <code>comparePassword()</code> and set token\\n  expire time span. If success, it will response with a user object, token and\\n  login status.\\n</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"frontend\\\">Frontend</h5>\\n<p>\\n  First, I created a <code>authService.ts</code> service to hold all\\n  login/register related functions. Most of the communication made from frontend\\n  to backend is using headers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Inside the register and login pages I created, I imported the\\n  <code>authService</code>, and used appropriate functions. Also, I want to hide\\n  certain pages such as <code>profile</code> from unlogged in users. To do that,\\n  I created a <code>authGuard</code> that detect logged in status from\\n  <code>authService</code> component. Also, I removed the link for that page\\n  from the navigation bar for better user experience.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"2consumeapi\\\">2. Consume API</h4>\\n<h4 id=\\\"3passdatatootherpages\\\">3.

We just thought that gelato could be a good choice.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The time frame was tight. We only got one day to shoot, two days to edit. On\\n  Sunday, we met at school and started brainstorming. Another challenge for us\\n  is that since we were the cast, we needed a way to connect ourselves with this\\n  brand. However, all of our group members were international students, so we\\n  found it hard to connect with this local brand, Tèo.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h3>Tactics</h3>\\n<p>\\n  One of the group members, Zoila proposed a great way to deal with that. We\\n  decided to create a story of five international students, new to UT became\\n  friend with each other after they enjoyed Tèo.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  At first, I did not agree on this, because I think this idea was a cliché. A\\n  lot of brands build themselves around the words like friendship, family,\\n  people, happiness, etc. However, I soon realized that this is the essence of\\n  our brand, Tèo.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Tèo is all about sharing happiness with families, as pictures on their website\\n  show. As international students, whose parents are far away from us, friends\\n  are who we spend most of the time with, we could rely on, and share happiness\\n  with. Then, our tagline was born, \\\"Be with your friends, and Tèo\\\".\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>What I Contributed...</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Since this project was taken place last November, and everyone was involved in\\n  the brainstorming process, (of course, it's an advertising class), I would\\n  mainly focus on my efforts on the execution part of this project.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  We all brainstormed, came up with incremental innovative ideas, all cast, and\\n  took turns to be the cameraman. Zoila and I were in charged with editing the\\n  video. I used Adobe Premiere for assembly the clips and sync with the BGM.\\n  Then, I used Adobe After Effects for the messaging effects, when we are\\n  texting to each other in the video. Finally, I exported it and Zolia posted\\n  the original ones to Vimeo.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>We as a Team</h2>\\n<p>Zili Peng, Yuxin Qin, Xindi Xu, Bo Yu, Yang Zhao</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"# JS

function\\n```javascript\\nconst foo = () =>{\\n  const v = \\\"value\\\";\\n  return v;\\n}\\n```\\n- function with only return value, no body\\nobmit the return keywords\\n```javascript\\nconst foo = () => \\\"value\\\"\\n```\\n- with parameter\\n```javascript\\nconst doubler = (num) => num * 2;\\n```\\n\\n*sidenote*\\n```javascript\\n// mutatable function\\nfunction add(x,y){return x+y;}\\nconsole.log(add(1,2)); //3\\nadd = function (x,y){return x-y;} // mutate the function :(\\n\\n// not mutatable function with const\\nconst add = function(x,y){return x+y;}\\n// or ES6\\nconst add = (x,y) => x + y;\\nadd = (x,y) => x - y; // error because of const\\n```\\n\\n#### Higer order arrow functions\\n##### filter()\\n```javascript\\nFBPosts.filter((post) => post.thumbnail != null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500);\\n```\\n##### map()\\n```javascript\\narr.map((num) => num * 2));\\n```\\n##### reduce()\\n```javascript\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].reduce((accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {\\n    return accumulator + currentValue;\\n}, 10);\\n```\\n.reduce() starts from currentIndex, default is 0\\n\\n##### Chaining functions\\n```javascript\\n  const squaredIntegers = arr.filter((num) => num > 0 && Number.isInteger(num)).map((num) => num * num);\\n```\\n### Operators \\n- function parameter with default value\\nfunction(arg1 = 1, arg2){}\\n\\n#### spread operator \\nspread the array to its elements\\n- spread to unpack the array\\n```javascript\\nfunction maximus = Math.max(...arr);\\n// Math.max() accepts comma-separated parameters, but not an array\\n// ...arr returns an unpacked array; it spreads the array\\n```\\n```javascript\\nfunction addThreeNumbers(x,y,z){\\n  return x+y+z;\\n}\\nvar args = [0,1,2,3]\\naddThreeNumbers(...args) //return 0+1+2, ignores 3\\n```\\n\\n- copy arrays\\n```javascript\\nconst arr = [1,2,3];\\nconst arr2 = [...arr]; // declare a new arr2 and copy value of arr to arr2\\nconst spreaded = ...arr; // error!\\n```\\n\\n- concate arrays\\n```javascript\\nvar arr1 = [0,1,2];\\nvar arr2 = [3,4,5];\\narr1 = [...arr1,\\\"mmm\\\",...arr2]; \\n```\\n\\n#### rest operator\\ncollect elements and pack them into an array\\nable to use array methods, since it is an array now \\n```javascript\\nfunction sum(...args){\\n  return args.reduce((acc,cur) => acc + cur,0);\\nsum(1,2,3,4,5,3);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Destructuring assignment \\nassigning values to multiple variables from an object \\nES5:\\n```javascript\\nvar voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54 };\\nvar x = voxel.x; // x = 3.6\\nvar y = voxel.y; // y = 7.4\\nvar z = voxel.z; // z = 6.54\\n```\\n#### to object\\nES6:\\n- basic\\n```javascript\\nconst {x,y,z} = voxel; // x = 3.6, y = 7.4, z = 6.54\\n```\\n- rename\\n\\\"get the field x and copy the value into a\\\"\\n```javascript\\nconst {x:a, y:b, z:c} = voxel; // a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.54\\n```\\n- nested object\\n```javascript\\nconst a = {\\n  start: { x: 5, y: 6},\\n  end: { x: 6, y: -9 }\\n};\\nconst { start : { x: startX, y: startY }} = a;\\nconsole.log(startX, startY); // 5, 6\\n```\\n#### to array\\n- basic\\n```javascript\\nconst [a,b,,,c] = [1,2,3,4,5,6];\\nconsole.log(a,b,c); //1,2,5\\n```\\n- to swap values\\n```javascript\\nlet a = 8, b = 6;\\n(() => {\\n  [a,b] = [b,a];\\n})();\\n```\\n- to reassign array elements\\nsimilar to Array.prototype.slice()\\n```javascript\\nconst [a,b,...arr] = [1,2,3,4,5,6];\\n// a = 1, b = 2, arr = [3,4,5,6]\\n```\\n#### to function \\ndestruct object in a function arg\\n```javascript\\nconst stats = {\\n  max: 56.78,\\n  standard_deviation: 4.34,\\n  median: 34.54,\\n  mode: 23.87,\\n  min: -0.75,\\n  average: 35.85\\n};\\nconst half = (function() {\\n  \\\"use strict\\\"; \\n  return function half({max,min}) {\\n    // use function argument destructuring\\n    return (max + min) / 2.0;\\n  };\\n\\n})();\\nconsole.log(stats); //  object\\nconsole.log(half(stats)); // 28.015\\n\\n// =>\\nconst half = ({max,min}) => (max + min) / 2.0;\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Template literals \\n```javascript\\nconst person = {\\n  name: \\\"Zodiac Hasbro\\\",\\n  age: 56\\n};\\n\\n// Template literal with multi-line and string interpolation\\nconst greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!\\nI am ${person.age} years old.`;\\n\\nconsole.log(greeting); // prints\\n// Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!\\n// I am 56 years old.\\n```\\n1. backticks(``) to wrap the string\\n2. multiline output, without \\\\n\\n3. ${variable} / ${a + b}\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst result = {\\n  success: [\\\"max-length\\\", \\\"no-amd\\\", \\\"prefer-arrow-functions\\\"],\\n  failure: [\\\"no-var\\\", \\\"var-on-top\\\", \\\"linebreak\\\"],\\n  skipped: [\\\"id-blacklist\\\",

resultDisplayArray;\\n}\\nconst resultDisplayArray = makeList(result.failure);\\n```\\n\\n### Object literal\\n`const getMousePos = (x,y) => { x,y };`\\nwhich is the same as:\\n`const getMousePos = (x,y) => { x:x, y:y };`\\n\\n### Function in a Object\\n```javascript\\n//ES 5\\nconst person = {\\n  name: \\\"Taylor\\\",\\n  sayHello: function() {\\n    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;\\n  }\\n};\\n\\n//ES 6\\nconst person = {\\n  name: \\\"Taylor\\\",\\n  sayHello() {\\n    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### Class syntax\\n*this is just a syntax, not a real class based on implementation of object oriented programming*\\n\\nclass is a special function\\n#### Constructor\\n```javascript\\n// ES5\\nvar SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){\\n  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;\\n}\\nvar zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');\\n\\n// ES6\\nclass SpaceShuttle {\\n  constructor(targetPlanet){\\n    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;\\n  }\\n}\\nvar zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');\\n```\\n\\n#### Getter & setter\\n\\n```javascript\\nclass Thermostat{\\n  constructor(farenheit){\\n    this.farenheit = farenheit;\\n  }\\n  get temperature(){\\n    return 5 / 9 * (this.farenheit - 32);\\n  }\\n  set temperature(celsius){\\n    this.farenheit = celsius * 9.0 / 5 + 32;\\n  }\\n}\\nconst thermos = new Thermostat(76);

I kept suggesting the team to switch to\\n  other frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular, or React. But, since future content\\n  updates will be done by people without coding experience, we have to stick to\\n  that.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  I had to go back and spend some time to clean up the site, restructure it, and\\n  install plugins to work around those limitations.\\n</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"result\\\">Result</h2>\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

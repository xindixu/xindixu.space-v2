  Empty stomach, don't want to get out, only some random stuffs left in your
  fridgeâ€¦ No worries, just get on this website and search for simple recipes
  based on the ingredients you've got.
</p>
<p>
  My boyfriend and I created this website for our Web Development class at UT.
  This website uses the MEAN stack: MongoDB for database, Express.js as backend
  framework, Angular as frontend framework, and Node.js for backend. The website
  also connects to a 3rd-party API for recipe search.

<h3 id="somedecisionstomake">Some decisions to make</h3>
<p>
  The first thing we agreed on our project is that we need to have a
  <strong>well-maintained API</strong> to provide high quality content. We found
  this Nutrition API, which grants us access to recipe informations and function
  calls.
</p>
<p>
  Since we have to work with <strong>API</strong> and
  <strong>user authentication</strong>, we have to build a backend and database
  for our website. We choose Express.js and Node.js for back-end because they
  are <strong>written in JS</strong> and MongoDB because it is a
  <strong>non-relational database</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  For frontend, we favors Angular because: 1) it has a well-organized and
  easy-to-understand documentation, 2) it use <strong>TypeScript</strong>, 3) it
  has a great <strong>CLI</strong> to help speed up the process. Although it is
  harder to learn than Vue.js and React, we still decided to use it.
</p>
<h3 id="getstarted">Get started</h3>
<p>
  I first started working on setting up both frontend and backend. It was quite
  challenging. Starting with backend, I set up <strong>Jwt-passport</strong> for
  user authentication, <strong>routes</strong> for functions related to users
  logins and API calls. Then, I did some configuration for database and
  passport.
</p>
<p>
  Then, I started with the frontend. With the help of Angular-CLI, it was quite
  easy. I set up the routes and a few pages for basic structure of the web app.
  I also referred to Google Material Design to style the theme and components
  for the app.
</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>
  There are several highlights during the implementation process. Some are quite
  challenging for me to figure out; some deepened my understanding a lot on the
  technologies I used.
</p>
<h4 id="1usermodelandauthentication">1. User model and authentication</h4>
<h5 id="backend">Backend</h5>
<p>
  In the backend, I created a file <code>user.js</code> under
  <code>model</code> folder. Here, I connected to Mongoose, the database,
  constructed <code>UserSchema</code>, and exports as model for database. I
  wrote some functions such as <code>getUserById()</code> and
  <code>getUserByUsername()</code> with Mongoose built-in functions
  <code>findById()</code> and <code>findOne()</code>. Then, I implemented
  functions to hash and compare passwords with <strong>bcrypt.js</strong>. I
  used <code>hash()</code> function came with bcrypt to to encrypt password when
  adding users. For comparing passwords, I used <code>compare()</code> came with
  bcrypt.
</p>
<p>
  Then, in the <code>routes</code> folder, I started another
  <code>user.js</code> file to call the functions I created in
  <code>model/user.js</code> file and create routes for frontend use. All the
  method used by router here is <code>post</code>. <code>Register</code> part is
  fairly easy: basically create user model with the data from the
  <code>request body</code> and add user to the database. For
  <code>authenticate</code>, it is a little bit more complicated. First, we call
  function <code>getUserByUsername()</code> and check if there is a particular
  user. Then, we call function <code>comparePassword()</code> and set token
  expire time span. If success, it will response with a user object, token and
  login status.
</p>
<h5 id="frontend">Frontend</h5>
<p>
  First, I created a <code>authService.ts</code> service to hold all
  login/register related functions. Most of the communication made from frontend
  to backend is using headers.
</p>
<p>
  Inside the register and login pages I created, I imported the
  <code>authService</code>, and used appropriate functions. Also, I want to hide
  certain pages such as <code>profile</code> from unlogged in users. To do that,
  I created a <code>authGuard</code> that detect logged in status from
  <code>authService</code> component. Also, I removed the link for that page
  from the navigation bar for better user experience.

<h3>15 - Fifteen</h3>
<p>
  Not going to lie... our first meeting was a chaos. But it got better later
  after we settled down with team structures. We had 3 group: artistry,
  structure, and lights, and those further divided into several sub-teams. Since
  a lot of parts were connected with each other, close collaboration with
  EVERYONE was critical.
</p>
<p>
  The picture on the left is our task breakdown, and each pink sticker
  represents one person in our class. This is the initial plan, and everything
  gets complicated as we moving down the road.
</p>

<h3>2 - Two</h3>
<p>
  The picture on the right is my dear teammate, Delena, and me. We are in the
  hand's team, designing, constructing controllable raptor hands. After months
  of prototyping, we finally made 3 pairs of hands, with various designs that
  reflect the evolution of the raptors.
</p>
<p>
  After researching online, Delena came up with our very first HUGE hand. Around
  the 3rd week, we started learning and using CNC machine. Also around that
  point, I came up with several ideas: gloves to ensure performers' control and
  comfort, small jewelry chains to adjust the length, etc. Later on, we switched
  to the laser cutter for better precision. I was mostly in charge of cutting
  wood pieces and putting them and springs together to make functioning raptor
  hands, while Delena was mostly responsible for making gloves and attachment to
  the raptor hand.
</p>

<h2>What I did...</h2>

<h3>Hand</h3>
<p>
  Delena was good at making artistic designs, while I was good at making
  incremental innovations. Basically, after we presented on Monday, we would
  discuss the next steps, based on suggestions, feedbacks, field-notes from
  classmates, performers, our director, and designer. Then, we would both work
  on editing the file in Illustrator, and I would go to the foundry and laser
  cut those wood pieces before Wednesday. After that, we would go paint those
  pieces, and I would assemble everything together. Delena made most of the
  gloves, and she has done a great job on sewing.
</p>
<h3>Claws</h3>
<p>
  At the middle of the semester, one of our classmates dropped the course, so we
  took over with making teeth and claws. I designed the 3D model in Maya, and
  cut it into two different lengths for teeth and claws. Then, I learned 3D
  printing process and started 3D printing. It was a very time-consuming
  process, and I am very thankful that our classmates contributed their time in
  monitoring the printer for us.
</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>
  During the final weeks, I jumped into the electric team, helping them to
  solder the central shields for lighting effects, and making the LED stripes,
  and EL wires. Since they were lack of people to meet the deadline, we worked
  very hard, late until 2 am, and all weekends. On Friday, few days before the
  unleashing date, we found a severe design problem: the LED stripes should be
  connected in parallel, to ensure the flow direction and enough voltage flowing
  through. With our hard work, thankfully, we got everything to work on the
  unleashing event.

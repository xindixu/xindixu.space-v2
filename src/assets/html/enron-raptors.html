    <h3>15 - Fifteen</h3>
    <p>
      Not going to lie... our first meeting was a chaos. But it got better later
      after we settled down with team structures. We had 3 group: artistry,
      structure, and lights, and those further divided into several sub-teams.
      Since a lot of parts were connected with each other, close collaboration
      with EVERYONE was critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture on the left is our task breakdown, and each pink sticker
      represents one person in our class. This is the initial plan, and
      everything gets complicated as we moving down the road.
    </p>

    <h3>2 - Two</h3>
    <p>
      The picture on the right is my dear teammate, Delena, and me. We are in
      the hand's team, designing, constructing controllable raptor hands. After
      months of prototyping, we finally made 3 pairs of hands, with various
      designs that reflect the evolution of the raptors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After researching online, Delena came up with our very first HUGE hand.
      Around the 3rd week, we started learning and using CNC machine. Also
      around that point, I came up with several ideas: gloves to ensure
      performers' control and comfort, small jewelry chains to adjust the
      length, etc. Later on, we switched to the laser cutter for better
      precision. I was mostly in charge of cutting wood pieces and putting them
      and springs together to make functioning raptor hands, while Delena was
      mostly responsible for making gloves and attachment to the raptor hand.

  <h2>What I did...</h2>

    <h3>Hand</h3>
    <p>
      Delena was good at making artistic designs, while I was good at making
      incremental innovations. Basically, after we presented on Monday, we would
      discuss the next steps, based on suggestions, feedbacks, field-notes from
      classmates, performers, our director, and designer. Then, we would both
      work on editing the file in Illustrator, and I would go to the foundry and
      laser cut those wood pieces before Wednesday. After that, we would go
      paint those pieces, and I would assemble everything together. Delena made
      most of the gloves, and she has done a great job on sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, we all explored on media menu. Finally, Regina put everything
      together in PowerPoint, and make it neat and stylish.
    </p>
    <h3>Claws</h3>
    <p>
      At the middle of the semester, one of our classmates dropped the course,
      so we took over with making teeth and claws. I designed the 3D model in
      Maya, and cut it into two different lengths for teeth and claws. Then, I
      learned 3D printing process and started 3D printing. It was a very
      time-consuming process, and I am very thankful that our classmates
      contributed their time in monitoring the printer for us.
    </p>
    <h3>Lights</h3>
    <p>
      During the final weeks, I jumped into the electric team, helping them to
      solder the central shields for lighting effects, and making the LED
      stripes, and EL wires. Since they were lack of people to meet the
      deadline, we worked very hard, late until 2 am, and all weekends. On
      Friday, few days before the unleashing date, we found a severe design
      problem: the LED stripes should be connected in parallel, to ensure the
      flow direction and enough voltage flowing through. With our hard work,
      thankfully, we got everything to work on the unleashing event.

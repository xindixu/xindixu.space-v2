  <strong>Nokia Demo Center Website</strong> is the website for Nokia Sales and
  Pre-sales people to look for <strong>product demonstrations</strong> to their
  clients. This project is a combination of website front-end design and
  development.

<p>
  It took me quite a bit of time to define our target audience for the website.
  I set up several meetings with my manager and supervisor to create personas
  for our target audience.
</p>
<p>
  I first created a list of functionalities to better help them. I started to
  modify the user experience flow so that they can get to their destination,
  Demo System, quicker. I deleted redundant pages and sections to make the
  website much cleaner.
</p>
<p>
  Then I move onto the visual design part. It is such an iterative process,
  reviewing Nokia Brand Guidelines, consulting my supervisor day after day,
  running back to my desk and spending hours in Sketchâ€¦
</p>
<p>
  After comparing several versions of website, Nokia Digital Experience Lab Team
  finally approved my design and I could start implementing it with WordPress.
</p>
<p>
  However, WordPress makes the implementation harder. It limits my freedom to
  modify HTML and use JavaScript. The webpages take a long time to load. Tons of
  stylesheets and code snippets, came with original template, floating around
  make debugging hard.
</p>
<p>
  Conclusion, I don't like WordPress. I kept suggesting the team to switch to
  other frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular, or React. But, since future content
  updates will be done by people without coding experience, we have to stick to
  that.
</p>
<p>
  I had to go back and spend some time to clean up the site, restructure it, and
  install plugins to work around those limitations.

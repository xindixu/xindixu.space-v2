<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
  This is a hypothetical advertising campaign for Telsa Motor, aiming to
  advocate the "Tesla Lifestyle" created by our team, Little Bean Co. "Next
  Thing You Charge" is our tagline, implying that our revolutionary Telsa Motor
  is the future, and the future is around the corner. Our electronic car is just
  another "device" you need to add to your existing devices.

<p>
  As always, we started our project with lots of research, and we finally boiled
  everything down into this SWOT analysis.
</p>

<h3>Brainstorming</h3>

<p>
  Our first meeting to brainstorm was Saturday morning, for real. We sat down,
  chatted, and had coffee, worked back and forth, to come up with our strategy.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal was to cultivate preference and encourage adoption. Our targets,
  young, tech-savvy and affluent professional considers that our high-quality
  technology, Tesla was distant. Thus, we wanted to create a Tesla lifestyle and
  advocated that.
</p>
<p>
  I love this process so much because it was such a collaborative, creative
  process while critical thinking and analytical skills were still required.

<h2>Execution</h2>

<h3>Interactive YouTube Ad</h3>
<div class="text-center">
  <img
    class="img-fluid"
    src="/img/work/tesla-motors/tesla04.webp"
    alt="YouTube interactive ad"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>
<p>
  This is an interactive YouTube, pre-roll ad. At first, we ask the viewer to
  press their spacebar as fast as they could to accelerate this traditional car.
  But no matter how hard they try; this car moves pretty slow. Then, they are
  going to plug in the other car, our Tesla Motor. Then, as soon as they press
  the spacebar, this car will accelerate to desired speed, within a much shorter
  period. The ad ends with our tagline, and it takes them to our website.
</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is engaging and fits the brand</li>
  <li>
    Gives the clients with countable results and huge data about the potential
    buyers
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lenticular Print Ad</h3>
<div class="text-center">

    alt="YouTube interactive ad"

  />
</div>
<p>
  This ad is created for a magazine, using a special printing technique,
  lenticular printing. Readers can tilt this picture, just as want you did, and
  see the transition between the car interior and the office. Our message was:
  "You can work as you drive". The idea is easy for execution because I can just
  substitute the picture of office with makeup station, etc. And the message
  changed to do your makeup whileâ€¦
</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fits the brand again</li>
  <li>Attracts the attention and breaks the cluster.</li>
</ul>

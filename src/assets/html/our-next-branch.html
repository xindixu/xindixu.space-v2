<h2>Project Description</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2018, I interned at Daikin of North America, Goodman Manufacturing LLC. Our-next-branch is my personal project. This was my first time working with Tableau and I feel so honored until today when I learned that the company was actually using this visualization to make decisions. </p>


<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>This tool is designed to help users find out which area in North America has an insufficient supply of HVAC distributors.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>1. Scrape Website Data</h3>
<p>Since there are more than 60 distributors's website to go through, I turned to <em>ParseHub</em> for web scraping. I first inspected the HTML structure of the webpage and constructed the <em>code</em> to scrape data.</p>
<p>Scraping web data makes future update a lot easier! The company just have to run the scraping script every once a while and collect all data in .csv format.</p>

<h3>2. Batch Geocoding with Google Map API</h3>
<p>Because the address data I collected are not precise enough, I used Google Map API to standardize the address and batch geocode.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong> script for outputing standardized address:</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>There are three categories of data: <strong>demand, supply, and performance.</strong> Users can toggle filters to narrow down to specific data range, as well as highlight a certain value in a specific field. They can also collapse tabs to switch views among state, city and zip code.</p>

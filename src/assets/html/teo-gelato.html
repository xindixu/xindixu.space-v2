<h2>How We Approach This...</h2>

<h3>Difficulties</h3>
<p>
  As the explanation video says, when we started the project, we have no idea
  what Tèo is. We just thought that gelato could be a good choice.
</p>
<p>
  The time frame was tight. We only got one day to shoot, two days to edit. On
  Sunday, we met at school and started brainstorming. Another challenge for us
  is that since we were the cast, we needed a way to connect ourselves with this
  brand. However, all of our group members were international students, so we
  found it hard to connect with this local brand, Tèo.
</p>

<h3>Tactics</h3>
<p>
  One of the group members, Zoila proposed a great way to deal with that. We
  decided to create a story of five international students, new to UT became
  friend with each other after they enjoyed Tèo.
</p>
<p>
  At first, I did not agree on this, because I think this idea was a cliché. A
  lot of brands build themselves around the words like friendship, family,
  people, happiness, etc. However, I soon realized that this is the essence of
  our brand, Tèo.
</p>
<p>
  Tèo is all about sharing happiness with families, as pictures on their website
  show. As international students, whose parents are far away from us, friends
  are who we spend most of the time with, we could rely on, and share happiness
  with. Then, our tagline was born, "Be with your friends, and Tèo".

<h2>What I Contributed...</h2>
<p>
  Since this project was taken place last November, and everyone was involved in
  the brainstorming process, (of course, it's an advertising class), I would
  mainly focus on my efforts on the execution part of this project.
</p>
<p>
  We all brainstormed, came up with incremental innovative ideas, all cast, and
  took turns to be the cameraman. Zoila and I were in charged with editing the
  video. I used Adobe Premiere for assembly the clips and sync with the BGM.
  Then, I used Adobe After Effects for the messaging effects, when we are
  texting to each other in the video. Finally, I exported it and Zolia posted
  the original ones to Vimeo.

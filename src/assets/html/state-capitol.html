  I made this architecture model during the first half of 2017 and gave to my
  ex-boyfriend as a gift. This is the 3rd architecture model I made and it is
  totally different from my previous ones.
</p>
<p>
  This model follows the design of the actual Texas Capitol. I found floor plans
  on their official website, as well as an online model from SketchUp. It can be
  separated into different parts: 1st, 2nd, 3rd floors, foyer, special rooms,
  roof, and dome. I put a lot of effort into making it as real as possible.
</p>
<p>
  All the materials are hand-cut. The beige outside walls are made of museum
  boards, inner walls cardboards. Windows on the wall and the dome are made of
  plastic sheets. I originally planned to use poly foam balls for dome but ended
  up with just cutting, bending and sticking the boards to form a half sphere.
  (And I painted those foam balls into eyeballs for Halloween.) I also used
  balsa wood sheets for decoration. For the orders in front, I used bamboo
  sticks.

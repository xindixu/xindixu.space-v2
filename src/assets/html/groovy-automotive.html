<p>
  Just as other professional media agencies, we, Agency6, started with
  conducting a significant amount of primary and secondary research. This
  benefits us a lot in terms of understanding our brand, its competitors, as
  well as local market and potential trade area.
</p>

<p>It is the research, that grant us creativity.</p>

<h2>Market Research</h2>

<h3>Brand Variables</h3>

<p>
  I first started with researching on Groovy's website familiarized myself with
  our brand and product. Then I went to Groovy's Facebook, Yelp, YouTube
  channel, Groupon, etc for more information. With my research, I came up with
  three keywords for Groovy: Highest Quality, Friendly, and Local.
</p>

<h3>Target Market</h3>

  Then, only after Kaci settled down our target audience and geographic profile,
  could I start with our media menu. After a few hours of exploration, I finally
  learned how to navigate SRDS database. In that database, I found:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CPP for local TV and Radio from SQAD</li>
  <li>
    Circulation and Ad rates for local newspaper and magazine in our DMA from
    AAA, with a special focus on ZIP code 80904
  </li>
  <li>
    Display Ad audience metrics & CPM for local & nearby DMA websites from
    comScore, with a special focus on measuring visitors aged 25-34, 45-54, and
    65+
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  With Google Adwords, I worked with Regina, first coming up with ideas on
  various groups of keywords. Then, we entered them into Keyword Planner, set
  bid to $3.00, and exported data on clicks, impression, cost, CTR, Avg CPC,
  etc.
</p>

<p>
  On Blue Line Media website, Alejandro and I searched for various OOH media
  placements, collecting data their potential showings and costs.

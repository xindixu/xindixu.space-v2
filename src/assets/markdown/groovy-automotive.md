## Description

This is a hypothetical media planning project for Austin local brand, Groovy Automotive.

**Groovy Automotive** has been serving up fun, reliable, and reasonable auto services as the "honest, neighborhood garage" since 1993. Recently, they have been decided to take their story on the road and launch an experimental store in Colorado Springs, CO, a city synonymous with the ideas and persona of "groovy".

Just as other professional media agencies, we, Agency6, started with conducting a significant amount of primary and secondary research. This benefits us a lot in terms of understanding our brand, its competitors, as well as local market and potential trade area.

I first started with researching on Groovy's website familiarized myself with our brand and product. Then I went to Groovy's Facebook, Yelp, YouTube channel, Groupon, etc for more information. With my research, I came up with three keywords for Groovy: Highest Quality, Friendly, and Local.

Then, only after Kaci settled down our target audience and geographic profile, could I start with our media menu. After a few hours of exploration, I finally learned how to navigate SRDS database. In that database, I found:

- CPP for local TV and Radio from SQAD
- Circulation and Ad rates for local newspaper and magazine in our DMA from AAA, with a special focus on ZIP code 80904
- Display Ad audience metrics & CPM for local & nearby DMA websites from comScore, with a special focus on measuring visitors aged 25-34, 45-54, and 65+.

With Google Adwords, I worked with Regina, first coming up with ideas on various groups of keywords. Then, we entered them into Keyword Planner, set bid to $3.00, and exported data on clicks, impression, cost, CTR, Avg CPC, etc.

On Blue Line Media website, Alejandro and I searched for various OOH media placements, collecting data their potential showings and costs.

## How We Collaborated

### 15 - Fifteen
Not going to lie... our first meeting was a chaos. But it got better later after we settled down with team structures. We had 3 group: artistry, structure, and lights, and those further divided into several sub-teams. Since a lot of parts were connected with each other, close collaboration with EVERYONE was critical.

The picture on the left is our task breakdown, and each pink sticker represents one person in our class. This is the initial plan, and everything gets complicated as we moving down the road.

### 2 - Two
The picture on the right is my dear teammate, Delena, and me. We are in the hand's team, designing, constructing controllable raptor hands. After months of prototyping, we finally made 3 pairs of hands, with various designs that reflect the evolution of the raptors.

After researching online, Delena came up with our very first HUGE hand. Around the 3rd week, we started learning and using CNC machine. Also around that point, I came up with several ideas: gloves to ensure performers' control and comfort, small jewelry chains to adjust the length, etc. Later on, we switched to the laser cutter for better precision. I was mostly in charge of cutting wood pieces and putting them and springs together to make functioning raptor hands, while Delena was mostly responsible for making gloves and attachment to the raptor hand.

### Hands
Delena was good at making artistic designs, while I was good at making incremental innovations. Basically, after we presented on Monday, we would discuss the next steps, based on suggestions, feedbacks, field-notes from classmates, performers, our director, and designer. Then, we would both work on editing the file in Illustrator, and I would go to the foundry and laser cut those wood pieces before Wednesday. After that, we would go paint those pieces, and I would assemble everything together. Delena made most of the gloves, and she has done a great job on sewing.

### Claws
At the middle of the semester, one of our classmates dropped the course, so we took over with making teeth and claws. I designed the 3D model in Maya, and cut it into two different lengths for teeth and claws. Then, I learned 3D printing process and started 3D printing. It was a very time-consuming process, and I am very thankful that our classmates contributed their time in monitoring the printer for us.

### Lights
During the final weeks, I jumped into the electric team, helping them to solder the central shields for lighting effects, and making the LED stripes, and EL wires. Since they were lack of people to meet the deadline, we worked very hard, late until 2 am, and all weekends. On Friday, few days before the unleashing date, we found a severe design problem: the LED stripes should be connected in parallel, to ensure the flow direction and enough voltage flowing through. With our hard work, thankfully, we got everything to work on the unleashing event.

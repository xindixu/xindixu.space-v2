## Description

**Nokia Demo Center Website** is the website for Nokia Sales and Pre-sales people to look for **product demonstrations** to their clients. This project is a combination of website front-end design and development.

## Challenges

1. The audience group is not clearly defined and understood
2. The purpose of the website is confusing
3. WordPress framework makes the development process painful

## Solutions

It took me quite a bit of time to define our target audience for the website. I set up several meetings with my manager and supervisor to create personas for our target audience.

I first created a list of functionalities to better help them. I started to modify the user experience flow so that they can get to their destination, Demo System, quicker. I deleted redundant pages and sections to make the website much cleaner.

Then I move onto the visual design part. It is such an iterative process, reviewing Nokia Brand Guidelines, consulting my supervisor day after day, running back to my desk and spending hours in Sketch...

After comparing several versions of website, Nokia Digital Experience Lab Team finally approved my design and I could start implementing it with WordPress.

However, WordPress makes the implementation harder. It limits my freedom to modify HTML and use JavaScript. The webpages take a long time to load. Tons of stylesheets and code snippets, came with original template, floating around make debugging hard.

Conclusion, I don't like WordPress. I kept suggesting the team to switch to other frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular, or React. But, since future content updates will be done by people without coding experience, we have to stick to that.

I had to go back and spend some time to clean up the site, restructure it, and install plugins to work around those limitations.
